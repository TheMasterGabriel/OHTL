# Open HTML Template Language
OHTL is a new paradigm for cross-language HTML templating designed with ease-of-use, exentiblity and applicability as it's core tenants.

> Front-end HTML is written exactly the same no matter what your backend is written in, and it follows that HTML templates should be as well. Templating can be weird enough when first starting, and having to relearn a new templating markup for each of your backend languages is simply cumbersome and unnecessary. The Open HTML Template Language is _dynamic_ to whatever backend language you are using. An OHTL file within a Rails app will parse with Ruby, and an OHTL file within an ExpressJS app will parse with JavaScript. It's so simple it's almost _magic_.
